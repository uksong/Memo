1. Visited GitBub website and started to read the guideline.
  - Created an open source repository
  - Started and managed a new branch
  - Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
  - Opened and merged a Pull Request
  - Guide - Understanding the GitHub Flow
  - The GitHub Desktop

2. Visited GibLab website
  - Watched the introduction vedio

3. Next tutorial

<TODOs>
  1. Make a project with the source codes I have. (i.e., the one for master degree)
  2. Try to make new project.
  3. To learn 'GitLab'. GitLab seems to have more useful and convenient features.
